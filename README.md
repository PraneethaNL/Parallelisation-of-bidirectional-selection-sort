# Parallelisation-of-bidirectional-selection-sort
 There are two bidirectional selection sort algorithms. The .c files contains these two algorithms written in c and OpenMP.
 OpenMp is used for parallelization of the code.
 As the input size increases for example for sorting ten thousand elements 1st algo takes leeser time when comapred to the second algo in OpenMP.
