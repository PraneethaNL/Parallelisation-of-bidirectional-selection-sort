# Parallelisation-of-bidirectional-selection-sort
 There are two bidirectional selection sort algorithms. The .c files contains these two algorithms written in c and OpenMP
 OpenMp is used for parallelization of the code.
 openmp _ bss.c contains the 1st algo and x.c contains the 2nd algo. As the input size increases for example for sorting ten thousand elements 1st algo takes leeser time when comapred to the second algo in OpenMP.
